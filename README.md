1. As a user, I would like to click on my picture to show me a random act of kindness and who I should target for it so that I can carry out the act.

2. As a user, I would like to be able to check a task as done so that I can keep tabs on what I've achieved.

3. As a user, I would like to be able to blog about how carrying out the task made me feel so that I can record my reflection.

4. As a user, I would like to be able to check off whether I got caught so that I can make it into a challenge.

5. As a user, I want to be able to go to a "completed" page so that I can see what tasks my cohort have carried out.
